          Estuaries and nearshore habitats are ranked among the worldâ€™s most
          productive ecosystems, providing social, ecological, cultural and
          economic benefits as well as a full array of ecosystem services. The
          constantly changing water chemistry, water level, and sedimentation
          creates unique challenges and opportunities for the organisms that
          make their homes in estuaries.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Pacific Marine & Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership (PMEP) mapped
          the current and historic extent of estuaries using models of extreme
          high water levels and high resolution elevation information. This
          allowed PMEP to determine areas that are inundated by the highest
          annual tides. PMEP then used the National Wetland Inventory, local
          knowledge, and other information to refine these boundaries. These
          estuary boundaries encompass all tidal wetlands, and they extend from
          the ocean to the head of the tide, including the freshwater tidal
          zone.
